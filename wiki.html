Beyblade X: The current generation, focusing on speed with metal parts and a "Extreme Line" on the stadium.<br> 
<img src="bex.png"width="300cm">Beyblade X is the fourth generation of the popular spinning top toy franchise, featuring fast-paced battles,<br> metal parts, and a focus on high-speed action in specially designed stadiums with an "Extreme Line" <br>for unique boosts. The series includes a manga and anime, following protagonists aiming <br>to become pro bladers, emphasizing strategy and the synergy between powerful "X-Data" Beyblades and<br> skilled bladers. Key features include customizable three-part Beyblades <br>(blade, ratchet, bit) and a competitive meta where Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Balance types have strengths and weaknesses.<br> 
Key Aspects of Beyblade X<br>
High-Speed Gameplay: The core innovation is the "Extreme Line," a sloped section in the stadium that boosts Beyblades<br> for intense, fast matches.<br>
Three-Part Customization: Beyblades are built from three components: the metal Blade, the height-determining Ratchet,<br> and the spinning/burst-resistant Bit, allowing deep customization.<br>
Types: Beyblades fall into Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Balance, with an Attack > Stamina > Defense > Attack cycle<br> for type advantages.<br>
Anime & Manga: The story follows aspiring bladers, like Ekusu (Ex), training and competing to reach the top, with<br> characters focusing on strategy and mastering their powerful "X-Data" Beyblades.<br>
Realistic Battles: Compared to some past series, X aims for more grounded battles, focusing on the toy's mechanics<br> without monster summons, though it still has a competitive toy focus. <br>
What Makes It Different<br>
Focus on Speed: The "X" stadiums and parts are designed for aggressive, high-velocity clashes.<br>
X-Data & "X": The concept of "X-Data" links powerful Beyblades (like Drawn Buster, Wizard Arrow) to elite bladers, driving the narrative.<br>
Competitive Meta: While customizable, the competitive scene revolves around specific parts and combos, with high-tier releases like Shark Scale and Impact Drake being popular. <br>
